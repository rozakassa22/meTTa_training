Induction Proof

Base Case:
- Consider the smallest binary tree, which is a single node (leaf).
- For a single node, the depth is 1.
- This base case is correctly handled by the function returning 1 for a leaf node.

Inductive Step:
- Assume that the function works correctly for trees of height `h`.
- For a tree of height `h+1`, the tree is structured as a node with two subtrees (left and right).
- The function recursively calculates the maximum depth of both subtrees.
- The function then returns 1 plus the maximum depth of the two subtrees.
- By the induction hypothesis, each subtree correctly calculates its maximum depth.
- Therefore, adding 1 to the maximum of the depths of the two subtrees correctly calculates the maximum depth of the tree of height `h+1`.
