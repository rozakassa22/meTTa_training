Induction Proof

Base Case:
- Consider the smallest binary tree, which is a single node (leaf) containing the symbol.
- For a single node, the function will directly compare the node with the symbol.
- If the node matches the symbol, the function returns True.
- If the node does not match the symbol, the function returns False.
- This base case is correctly handled by the first two cases in the function.

Inductive Step:
- Assume that the function works correctly for trees of height `h`.
- For a tree of height `h+1`, the tree is structured as a node with two subtrees (left and right).
- The function recursively checks for the symbol in both subtrees.
- The function then returns the logical OR of the results from both subtrees.
- By the induction hypothesis, each subtree correctly determines the presence of the symbol within it.
- Therefore, the logical OR of the results from both subtrees correctly determines the presence of the symbol in the tree of height `h+1`.
